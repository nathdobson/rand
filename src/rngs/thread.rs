// Rationale for using `UnsafeCell` in `ThreadRng`:
//
// Previously we used a `RefCell`, with an overhead of ~15%. There will only
// ever be one mutable reference to the interior of the `UnsafeCell`, because
// we only have such a reference inside `next_u32`, `next_u64`, etc. Within a
// single thread (which is the definition of `ThreadRng`), there will only ever
// be one of these methods active at a time.
//
// A possible scenario where there could be multiple mutable references is if
// `ThreadRng` is used inside `next_u32` and co. But the implementation is
// completely under our control. We just have to ensure none of them use
// `ThreadRng` internally, which is nonsensical anyway. We should also never run
// `ThreadRng` in destructors of its implementation, which is also nonsensical.


// Number of generated bytes after which to reseed `ThreadRng`.
// According to benchmarks, reseeding has a noticable impact with thresholds
// of 32 kB and less. We choose 64 kB to avoid significant overhead.

/// The type returned by [`thread_rng`], essentially just a reference to the
/// PRNG in thread-local memory.
///
/// `ThreadRng` uses the same PRNG as [`StdRng`] for security and performance.
/// As hinted by the name, the generator is thread-local. `ThreadRng` is a
/// handle to this generator and thus supports `Copy`, but not `Send` or `Sync`.
///
/// Unlike `StdRng`, `ThreadRng` uses the  [`ReseedingRng`] wrapper to reseed
/// the PRNG from fresh entropy every 64 kiB of random data.
/// [`OsRng`] is used to provide seed data.
///
/// Note that the reseeding is done as an extra precaution against side-channel
/// attacks and mis-use (e.g. if somehow weak entropy were supplied initially).
/// The PRNG algorithms used are assumed to be secure.
